            <h2>Mona Lisa (La Gioconda)</h2>
            <h3>Leonardo Da Vinci</h3>
            The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait of a Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo, by the Italian
            artist Leonardo da Vinci. It has been acclaimed as "the best known, the most visited, the most written
            about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world."
            Believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506, it was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now
            the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at the Musée du Louvre in Paris.

            <h2>The Scream</h2>
            <h3>Edvard Munch</h3>
            The Scream was painted by Norwegian Expressionist artist Edvard Munch and is one of his most recognised
            artworks. It was initially named The Scream of Nature, as it was inspired by an evening walk Munch took with
            his friends, where he experienced a 'scream piercing through nature. This makes the painting
            autobiographical, but the figure does not resemble him or anyone, in fact, the figure has been
            depersonalized and rendered genderless/sexless, curves of their body aligning with the curves around...
